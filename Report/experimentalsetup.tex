\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{TensorFlow}
TensorFlow (~\cite{tensorflow}) is a machine learning system that is designed to operate at large scale across numerous heterogeneous distributed systems. TensorFlow using dataflow graphs to represent the desired computation for a machine learning algorithm. TensorFlow allows distributing the computation
