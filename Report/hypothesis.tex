\section{Leveraging heterogeneous approximation to accelerate distribute training}
\subsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hypothesis \#1:} Layers in the neural network have varying sensitivity towards approximation and asynchrony.
\item \textbf{Hypothesis \#2:} Varying asynchrony and approximation over training time reducing training time while preserving convergence.
\end{itemize}
