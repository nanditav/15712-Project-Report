\section{Challenges}

In this section, we discuss the challenges faced while setting
up TensorFlow and the cluster for distributed training

Setting up the CIFAR10 model in TensorFlow for distributed training
dominated the setup time for TensorFlow. The next challenge was to 
change the TensorFlow model to elide updates to different layers
of the neural network. 

Our initial experiments with TensorFlow displayed very high variance
in results between runs. It took us a while to trace this problem
to the mismatch in the compute nodes used for different runs. We solved
this problem to some extent by running TensorFlow on similar machines
in the compute cluster.
