\section{Conclusion}

From our evaluations of the impact of cache coherence in data-parallel
workloads, we find that cache coherence adds a significant overhead in terms of
latency, data-transmitted, energy and performance to the memory hierarchy. The
amount of overhead depends on the extent of data communication between the
threads. In this project, we trade-off precision to reduce this overhead of
cache coherence. With this goal in mind, we proposed an approximate cache
coherence protocol with flexible error control. Our evaluations show that an
approximate coherence protocol reduces the number of coherence misses,
directory lookups and invalidate traffic.
