\section{Introduction}

One of the major challenges in Approximate Computing is 
to target approximations which lie on the pareto-optimal
boundary of performance and program quality. Compilers prove
to be useful tools for finding \emph{good} approximation 
targets that maximize performance while bounding the
quality degradation of the program. In this project, we aim
to develop a compiler analysis pass that finds approximation
opportunities while simultaneously providing some form of a guarantee on the
error introduced into the program.

Research in the field of parallel computing has 
identified data movement as one of the major impediments
to continued performance scaling  with increasing core counts. Data movement is necessary for a
program to execute \emph{correctly}. However, a growing class
of applications, like image processing, data mining and machine learning,
are displaying a tolerance to errors in  
program values. For these applications, it is a good idea to limit the 
amount of data sharing in order to improve performance at the cost of 
small errors in the overall output of programs.

\section{Idea}

Most modern multi-core processors implement data movement among cores
using cache coherence. In this project, we wish to explore the impact 
of cutting
coherence operations on the performance of applications and the 
resulting quality degradation. 

Our mechanism of cutting cache coherence is to partition the
existing L1 cache, private to each core, into coherent and 
incoherent parts. The incoherent cache will not
enforce any form of coherence among multiple cores and, thus,
houses data that is strictly private to a core. The benefit of having private
data is reduced communication among cores, which is essentially a 
serializing operation in a parallel execution. 

While eliminating inter-core communication via data privatization
will surelyo improve the performance of parallel programs, we must at the same time
be strategic about our decision as to when to privatize data. This 
decision controls the quality of a program. This is where we plan to 
utilize a compiler to identify approximation opportunities that will 
yield performance improvement at the cost of insignificant error in the
program output.

In order to estimate the potential damage due to approximation, we aim
to develop a compiler pass that will analyse the impact of different 
variables used in a program on program quality. We will then mark data as approximable based 
on the frequency of data reuse in the program. This pass will be 
described in greater detail in the next section.

\section{Mechanism}

As mentioned before, we need to strategically place data
in the incoherent cache in order to contain the error in the 
program output to tolerable values. Our compiler analysis will search
for shared data in programs whose correctness is not critical to 
program quality. In order to do this, we first need to identify 
shared data that can be approximated. 

As an initial version of the project, we consider data 
that is guarded by synchronization operations. Prior research 
in approximate computing has shown that removing synchronization 
can be an effective way to explore the performance-correctness 
tradeoff. We extend this concept by stating that if a
synchronization operation is deemed unnecessary then 
providing coherence for the data value being guarded is also 
not essential. In this manner, our compiler pass builds a 
set of candidates that can be approximated. 

The next task is to select the data values, from the 
above list of possible candidates, that will not cause 
significant quality degradation. In order to find such
variables, we perform a liveness analysis of the candidates 
and determine the program lifetime of each variable. We use
lifetime as a proxy for the importance of a variable on program
quality. Variables with shorter lifetimes might not effect program 
quality much and vice versa. We aim to explore other dataflow 
analyses and metrics to find relative importance in subsequent
versions of our pass. We are also considering passing a 
\emph{quality threshold} as an argument to our pass which can then statically vary the
amount of variables being approximated. 

Since our proposal relies on hardware not found in existing 
architectures, we introduce ISA extensions that will place data into 
the incoherent cache. Our compiler pass will annotate the binary
with these special instructions to convey to the hardware (simulated) 
that the data value must be placed in an incoherent cache. Subsequent
accesses to the data value by a core will modify the data stored in its
incoherent, private cache. 

While the previous paragraph discussed moving data from the coherent cache to 
the incoherent cache, we might also have to do the opposite at times. 
This could be a way to limit the accumulation of error value in a program. 
In order to get a coherent copy from at incoherent copy we
apply an approximation based on the computation being performed
on the original shared data. For example, if the operation being 
performed on the original shared data was addition then we 
apply the updates of the addition to the local value in each core. 
When it is time to convert the local value to a global value, 
we randomly select the value from the incoherent cache of one
of the cores and assume that the other cores also computed 
the same value and update the local copy with a multiple of the total number of threads. After performing this \emph{approximate merge}
we place the data in the coherent cache and from this 
point on all, the cores see a coherent data value.

In the initial version of our compiler pass, we will 
support only limited computations on shared data and their
corresponding approximations (which will be similar in the 
spirit of \cite{paraprox}). We aim to implement more
general operations in subsequent versions.

\section{Infrastructure}

In order to compute the performance benefit of our approximation
we will be using a PIN based cache simulator. The simulator adds 
fixed cycle costs based on the level of cache from which the
data is accessed (three level cache modeled) and the coherence
state of the cacheline (MESI protocol modeled). The simulation
infrastructure is ready and has been in use for other research
for quite some time.

As part of this project, we will model a part of each cores
L1 cache as incoherent. Using PIN's routine instrumentation,
we can identify the data that needs to be stored in the incoherent
cache (stores only tag values). This way we can compare the 
execution time of the approximate version against the precise
version to quantify the performance improvement.

In order to evaluate the error in a program due to incoherent 
manipulation of data, we will make the compiler convert 
shared data into thread private data. Based on when the programmer
wishes to convert an incoherent data into a coherent data (through 
special functions/ISA extensions), we can randomly select one
of the thread private data, apply the approximate merge and convert
back to shared data. While we are actually duplicating data in 
the program, the logical view of the duplication is basically
storing the shared data in an incoherent cache. The duplication of data
allows us to run the effect of no coherence on a native machine
that has coherence.


\section{Project Plan}

We have broken down the project plan into the following steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item Write a compiler pass to identify sychronization operations
\item Design logic to identify the shared data that is guarded inside
these synchronization operations and build a list of potential approximation
targets
\item Perform liveness analysis on these candidates and characterize 
variables on the basis of their lifetimes from the start of the approximation
\item Apply the proper annotations (special functions identified by the simulator)
for the data values that should be approximated. Also, convert the shared data
into thread local data.
\item Identify the programmer routine that indicates the application of 
approximate merge and add the code to perform the merge into the program's binary
\item Run the generated \emph{approximate} binary on the simulator and a native machine to get 
an idea of the performance vs error tradeoff
\item Add support for more complex dataflow analysis for detection 
of approximation targets
\item Add support for more computations that can be approximated

\end{itemize}

\section{Work Distribution}

For the initial version of the compiler pass we will be working in tandem to 
set up the infrastructure. After the initial pass is complete, we will
concurrently try to add separate features to the compiler pass.

\section{Project goals}

We have set the following goals for ourselves:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{75\% goal:} Complete code annotation so that if we have any other heurestic
 for approximation then atleast the  performance benefit of the approximation can be tested on the simulation infrastructure
\item \textbf{100\% goal:} Implement a liveness analysis based pass that detects approximation opportunity for a set of computations on shared data. Explore the sensitivity of the quality threshold on the resultant performance and error values.
\item \textbf{125\% goal:} Implement other dataflow analyses and test other quality metrics to detect approximationr. Perform experiments to test the performance-accuracy tradeoff of different detection policies. Also, add support for more kinds of computations on shared data

\end{itemize}
